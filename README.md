# Web-Application-Development-COMP2011
Simple web applications that use a virtual environment to run. <br>
The virtual environment 'flask' has been provided. <br>
To run, type into the command line: <br>

<t>source flask/bin/activate <br>

This will create and run a virtual environment. This assumes you have anaconda3 and Python3+ installed. If not, you can install them from either of their respective vendor websites.

To install all necessary modules, run: <br>

<t>pip install requirement.text <br>
This should be done whilst in the virtual environment.

To run the website, input:<br>

<t>export FLASK_APP=run.py <br>
<t>export FLASK_ENV=development <br>
<t>flask run <br>
